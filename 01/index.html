<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>Worktations defines a fine line between holiday, remote work and sabbaticals. That  line is defined by ourselves and it is related with our definition of healthy work-life balance. Furthermore, the concept of Workation has been accelerated when the world turned digital during the COVID-19 pandemic and it is irreversible.</p>

<p>Just plan your next destination and go for that.</p>
