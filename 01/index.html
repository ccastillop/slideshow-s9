<p>Hello everybody. I am Cristiam, a software developer, and today we would dig on the amazing world of working and traveling at the same time.</p>

<p>I would like to cover three main points.</p>

<p>First, I will explain What is Workation and why is a huge trend for developers now.
Second, I would like to show how it could benefits you, and finally, 
we are going to plan our next month on Bali, together!</p>

<p>The workshop should last about five minutes and I’m happy to take any questions at any time.</p>

<p>What is Workation and why is a huge trend for developers now.</p>
