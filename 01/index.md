## 1.1 Corktation.

Worktation, ‘workoliday’ or ‘woliday’, 
Working while on vacation (work + vacation = workation).

As HR Technologist puts it:

> ‘A workation is a vacation that allows you to work remotely while integrating elements of leisure that let you unwind, relax and be more productive’.

## signal
So, that brings me to the end of the presentation

## summary
We have covered these points.

- First, I've explained What is Workation and why is a huge trend for developers now.
- Second, I've showed how it could benefits you
- Finally, we've planned our next trip to Bali!

## conclusion
Worktations defines a fine line between holiday, remote work and sabbaticals. That  line is defined by ourselves and it is related with our definition of healthy work-life balance. Furthermore, the concept of Workation has been accelerated when the world turned digital during the COVID-19 pandemic and it is irreversible. 

Just plan your next destination and go for that.
